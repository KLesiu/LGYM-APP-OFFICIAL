<h2>üßê Features</h2>
Here're some of the project's best features:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Authorization and Authentication</strong>: Secure user login via PassportJS and JWT.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized Workout Plans</strong>: Create a custom workout plan by selecting the number of training days and exercises, and set your own series and repetitions for each.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Training Sessions</strong>: Add new sessions based on your predefined training plans.</li>
    <li><strong>Comprehensive Training History</strong>: Access all past training sessions in one place with an overview of results and dates.</li>
    <li><strong>Powerlifting Records Tracking</strong>: Input your records, and the app will calculate your total.</li>
    <li><strong>Session-based Exercise Comparison</strong>: View past training results for the same type of workout during a current session.</li>
    <li><strong>ELO-Based Ranking System</strong>: The app calculates your ELO points based on your performance during each workout session. Consistent progress and regularity increase your ELO points, earning you higher ranks displayed on your profile. Conversely, missed workouts and lack of progress will reduce your ELO points and can lower your rank.</li>
    <li><strong>Global and Custom Exercise Database</strong>: Users can select from a global exercise database or add their own custom exercises with personalized names and descriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Progress Backup</strong>: The app stores your training progress in the device's local storage during each session, preventing data loss if your device turns off unexpectedly.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Exercise Management</strong>: Swap, add, remove, or compare exercises dynamically during a workout session.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible Training Schedules</strong>: Create multiple workout days tailored to your goals and requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar-Based Training History</strong>: A user-friendly calendar in the "History" section for a clear view of your workout history.</li>
    <li><strong>Competitive ELO Rankings</strong>: Users can compete for top spots on the leaderboard, motivating them to continue progressing in their training.</li>
    <li><strong>Ranking System with ELO Thresholds</strong>: Each rank has a set ELO point threshold, adding an extra motivational layer for progression.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Record Updates</strong>: After each training session, personal records are automatically updated and saved in the "Records" section.</li>
    <li><strong>Body Measurements Tracking</strong>: Users can log body measurements to track changes in their physique over weeks, months, or years.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Progress Graphs</strong>: Visualize progress over time for specific exercises, workout days, and body measurements.</li>
    <li><strong>Trainer Module</strong>: Users with a trainer account, with the permission of their trainees, can access their results and update their progress during personal training sessions, allowing trainees to fully focus on their workouts.</li>
</ul> 

<h2>History and Basic Information</h2>
<p text-align="justify">
    LGYM-APP is an application that allows you to track your progress while training at the gym. The idea was inspired by my own experiences. During weekly Sunday sessions of copying results from a smartphone to a paper notebook, I came up with the idea of using my coding skills to create my own application. This decision was driven by the lack of a suitable and fully customizable app that provides users with freedom in choosing exercises, workout plans, and training systems. Initially, the application was developed for browser use, but limitations such as restricted multitasking (e.g., minimizing the app to check messages) led me to try mobile app development. I rewrote the application using React Native with Expo. Currently, LGYM-APP is in a closed Beta testing phase on Google Play and will soon be released as a publicly available app on the Play Store.
